# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project is pre-`1.0` and ships an embeddable Go module with in-process local transport. The supported code line is the current default branch and the most recent `0.y.z` tag, if one exists.

Older pre-`1.0` tags are not guaranteed to receive fixes or backports.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not report vulnerabilities in public issues, pull requests, or discussions.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting from the repository Security tab. Include:

- a clear description of the issue
- affected files or workflow surfaces
- reproduction steps or proof-of-concept details
- expected impact and any known mitigations

If GitHub private reporting is temporarily unavailable, contact the repository owner through an existing private channel and share only enough detail to establish a private handoff. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly while that handoff is being arranged.

## Response expectations

These are targets, not contractual guarantees:

| Severity | Initial acknowledgment | Status update target | Patch or mitigation target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | within 2 business days | within 5 calendar days | within 14 calendar days |
| High | within 3 business days | within 7 calendar days | within 30 calendar days |
| Medium | within 5 business days | within 14 calendar days | next planned release or documented mitigation |
| Low | within 5 business days | as needed | next routine release if accepted |

## Severity handling

Maintainers will triage reports using practical impact on repository users and maintainers:

- Critical: repository compromise, credential exposure, arbitrary code execution in trusted automation, or release-integrity failure.
- High: meaningful integrity or privilege risk without a full repo compromise.
- Medium: exploitable weakness with limited blast radius or clear prerequisites.
- Low: hard-to-exploit issue, defense-in-depth gap, or low-impact misconfiguration.

## Patch and advisory process

- Fixes land privately first when needed to avoid widening exposure.
- Public release notes should avoid exploit-enabling detail until a fix or mitigation is available.
- If the repository later adopts GitHub Security Advisories, maintainers should publish advisories for material fixes.

## Emergency releases and hotfixes

If a vulnerability affects the latest supported code line, maintainers may cut an out-of-band patch tag and GitHub Release outside the normal release cadence.

Emergency releases should refresh the source archive, `SHA256SUMS`, SBOM, and GitHub attestations alongside the tag and release notes.
